The [proverbs](https://bradlindblad.github.io/proverbs/) R package now has support for the incredibly popular [ESV](https://www.esv.org/) Bible translation. View your daily proverb in this fluent and literal translation from the comfort of your R session.

You do have to grab a free API key from the ESV folks in order to integrate the translation, but it will take you \< 5 minutes to set this up.

For a detailed walkthrough - see [this vignette](https://bradlindblad.github.io/proverbs/articles/esv_api_key.html).
