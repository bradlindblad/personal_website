{cheatsheet} is a simple R package that downloads [helpful R cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) from the repository maintained by RStudio. You could easily just clone the repo these are [hosted at](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets) and filter them how you wish; this package is just a shortcut and more useful for people who aren't familiar with git.

## Installation

You can install the released version of cheatsheet from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cheatsheet")
```

## Usage

The main function here is `cheatsheet::get_all_cheatsheets`.

```r
library(cheatsheet)
library(fs)

# Get all cheatsheets and place in a folder on your desktop
cheatsheet::get_all_cheatsheets(local_path = "cheats", tidyverse_only = FALSE)
fs::dir_ls("cheats")

cheatsheet::get_all_cheatsheets(local_path = "cheats", tidyverse_only = TRUE)

# data-import.pdf            data-transformation.pdf

# lubridate.pdf              purrr.pdf
# strings.pdf                tidyeval.pdf

```

## Foreign language support

{cheatsheet} also lets you download cheatsheets that have been translated to over a dozen languages. Check which languages are available with this command:
```{r}
cheatsheet::list_languages()
```

Then, pass the language you want to this function:
```{r eval=FALSE}
cheatsheet::get_translation(local_path = "cheats", language = "german")

# base-r_de.pdf
# data-transformation-cheatsheet_de.pdf
# data-wrangling-german.pdf
# devtools-german.pdf
# ggplot2-german.pdf
# rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0-german.pdf
# shiny-german.pdf
# sparklyr-cheatsheet_de.pdf

```

If anyone has another known and established stash of cheatsheets that would be helpful for this package, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/bradlindblad/cheatsheet/issues) or pull request.
