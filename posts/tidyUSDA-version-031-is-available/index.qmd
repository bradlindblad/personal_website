Previously there was an issue with certain calls to the `tidyUSDA::getQuickstat()` function, where values that included an "&" were not passing through the API call.

This error has been resolved. Please updated your version of {tidyUSDA} with

`install.packages("tidyUSDA")`

You can check that you have the latest version with `packageVersion("tidyUSDA")`, which should return `[1] ‘0.3.1’`

I appreciate the community helping to continually improve {tidyUSDA}!
