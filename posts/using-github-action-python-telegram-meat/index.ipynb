With the [insane inflation](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/) in the price of meat recently, I've been really drawn to their weekly specials. I'll typically buy a few hundred dollars worth whenever one of my favorite cuts like ribeye or New York strip steak is at a reasonable price.\n",
