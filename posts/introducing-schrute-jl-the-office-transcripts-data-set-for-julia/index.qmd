In an effort to broaden my horizons, I've ported the popular Schrute package from both [R](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/) and [python](https://github.com/bradlindblad/schrutepy) to the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/).

The package has one function which returns a dataframe containing the entire transcripts from The Office; 55130 lines in 9 seasons. There are also attribute fields such as writer, director and imdb score for each episode.

For a complete rundown (Charles Miner), see the [package tutorial](https://bradlindblad.github.io/Schrute.jl/tutorial.html), or view the source code at the [Github repo](https://github.com/bradlindblad/Schrute.jl).
