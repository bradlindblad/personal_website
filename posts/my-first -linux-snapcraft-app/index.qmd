In an effort to continually improve both my linux and python skills, I decided to build a [snapcraft app](https://snapcraft.io/), which is the universal "app store" for linux machines.

What started off as a seemingly easy process turned into a weekend-long angst-filled coding episode that left me more agitated than not. The process for creating a snap seemed completely foreign to my hacky, data science code tendencies, but eventually I created a successful build and pushed the app to the website.

The app is an incredibly-simple python CLI tool, in fact, it was one of the first programs I had ever written in the language. It's a little rough, but it was the brush-clearing project I needed to get more comfy with the snapcraft process.
