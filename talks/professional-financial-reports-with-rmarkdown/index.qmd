I recently gave a lightning talk at the [Financial Industry R Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup/events/274718908/) on how you can use RMarkdown to create extremely professional reports using RMarkdown and a slew of other popular R tools.

You can re-watch the talk on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsaGSrM8aZ0)

You can also read the directions and overview at the [Github repo](https://github.com/bradlindblad/pro_reports_talk).
